## Search data

### Externally from the container
Search one of the sample users present in Ping Directory 
`docker exec -it ping-directory /opt/server/bin/ldapsearch -b dc=example,dc=com "(uid=user.0)"`{{execute}}

### Internally
The same command as above can be done in 3 easy steps
1. Grab an interactive shell
`docker exec -it ping-directory sh`{{execute}}

2. Issue the same command as before (without the docker call)
/opt/server/bin/ldapsearch -b dc=example,dc=com "(uid=user.0)"

3. Bonus points
close the interactive shell
`exit`{{execute}}

At the end of the day, how you use the tool is a matter of taste.
Whatever gets the job done.
