### Start PingFederate
`docker-compose up`{{execute}}

### Look at live logs
You can look at the pingfederate container starting up with this command:
`docker logs -f pingfederate`{{execute}}
Once the server is up and running, Ctrl-C out of the log tail.
You now have a running PingFederate container, you are ready for the next step...
